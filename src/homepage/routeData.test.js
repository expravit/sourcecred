   * But for the route "/about/team", "../logo.png" refers instead to
   * "/logo.png", which is not the intended semantics. Therefore, we
   * should consistently either include or omit trailing slashes to
   * avoid confusion.
   *
   * The choice is made for us by the fact that many web servers
   * (prominently, GitHub Pages and Python's SimpleHTTPServer) redirect
   * "/foo" to "/foo/" when serving "/foo/index.html".
   *
   * In theory, we might have some file routes like "/about/data.csv"
   * that we actually want to appear without a trailing slash. But those
   * are outside the scope of our React application, and should be
   * handled by a different pipeline (e.g., `copy-webpack-plugin`).
